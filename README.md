## üß† Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI, designed for a car dealership that offers various car models. The dashboard will enable the dealership to monitor and analyze sales performance by visualizing key metrics and trends. This will provide critical insights and allow data-driven decision-making.


## ü¶™ Objective
The primary goal is to develop a dynamic and comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard. It will present key performance indicators (KPIs) related to car sales in a visually accessible format, helping the company assess its performance over time and make strategic business decisions.


## üìù Problem Statement 1: KPIs Overview
The dashboard must deliver real-time insights into critical KPIs related to the company‚Äôs sales. These KPIs will help track performance, spot trends, identify areas for growth, and make well-informed decisions.

KPIs:
Sales Overview:
Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales
Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
YTD Sales vs. Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales
Average Price Analysis:

Cars Sold Metrics:

## üìù Problem Statement 2: Charts and Visualizations
The dashboard should include various visual elements to depict sales data and trends effectively.

Required Visuals:
YTD Sales Weekly Trend: A line chart showing weekly sales trends for the current year (YTD). The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis will display total sales.
YTD Total Sales by Body Style: A pie chart visualizing the YTD total sales distribution across different car body styles.
YTD Total Sales by Color: Another pie chart presenting YTD total sales based on car color.
YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: A map chart showcasing the geographic distribution of YTD car sales across dealer regions.
Company-Wise Sales Trend: A grid or table showing each company‚Äôs sales performance, including their name and YTD sales figures.
Detailed Sales Information: A comprehensive table displaying all relevant information for each car sale, such as car model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, and sale date.


## ü§ù Conclusion
The Car Sales Dashboard is designed to offer a complete overview of sales performance, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making and growth. By presenting key metrics and trends, it will allow the dealership to identify opportunities, optimize operations, and capitalize on market conditions.
